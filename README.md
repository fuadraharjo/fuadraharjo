### Hi there üëã, I'm Fuad As Data Scientist

I am a career switcher from Mechanical Engineering to become a Data Scientist. As an Entry-level data scientist, I took part in the international bootcamp program named TripleTen in Indonesia as a Data Scientist and completed all the courses in 9 months less or more. I have mastered quite a lot of data science fields such as Data Preprocessing/ETL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Business Analysis, Data Visualization, Collecting Data using Structured Query Language (SQL), Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Numerical Method, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Unsupervised Learning. I just completed all main projects in each sprint for more than 10 projects. You can ask anything via Email:[ariefraharjo95@gmail.com](mailto:ariefraharjo95@gmail.com) or LinkedIn:[Fuad Arief Raharjo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fuadraharjo/). You can check and fork my projects in this GitHub.

Here my Resume/CV --> [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ExSvZTdsxdEwvU7tzTUZMBsHw4ST7Dl5/view?usp=sharing)

Here are my skils üöÄ:
- Data Cleaning - clean and prepare data from unnecessary like missing values, duplicates, etc.
- ETL (Extract Transform Load) - extract data from resources, transform and run it for analytical processes.
- Data Analysis - analyzing data to gain insights, identifying patterns, trends, hypothesis testing, AB/testing, and etc.
- Math and Statistics - use math and statistics to simplify data analysis, calculating probability.
- Data Visualization - transform data into various visual graphs such as barcharts, trendlines, pie charts, scatterplots, boxplots, interactive visualizations (Plotly and PowerBI).
- Model Predictive - uses machine learning to assist in predicting future data for both the classification cases or the regression cases.
- Data Storytelling - storytelling with data to inform audiences of insights from data.
- Analytical and Problem Solving - think critically to understand the data and find the best solution based on the data.
- Business Intelligence - processing data into interactive business information.
