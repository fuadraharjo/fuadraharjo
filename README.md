### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fuad As Data Scientist

i, I'm a career switcher from Mechanical Engineering to becoming a Data Scientist. As an Entry Level data scientist, I took part in the international bootcamp program named Practicum in Indonesia as a Data Scientist which is still ongoing (it has been running for 5 months from 9 months). I have mastered quite a lot of data scientist fields such as Data Preprocessing/ETL, Exploratory Data Analyst (EDA), Business Analyst, Data Visualization and Machine Learning. I also have several projects that I have worked on on GitHub and also received several certificates such as from Kaggle, RevoU and Practicum (You can check on LinkedIn).

Here is my skils:
- Data Cleaning - clean and prepare data from unnecessary like missing values, duplicates, etc.
- ETL (Extract Transform Load) - extract data from resources, transform and run it for analytical processes.
- Data Analysis - analyzing data to gain insights, identifying patterns, trends, hypothesis testing, AB/testing, and etc.
- Math and Statistics - use math and statistics to simplify data analysis, calculating probability.
- Data Visualization - transform data into various visual graphs such as barcharts, trendlines, pie charts, scatterplots, boxplots, interactive visualizations (Plotly and PowerBI).
- Model Predictive - uses machine learning to assist in predicting future data for both the classification cases or the regression cases.
- Data Storytelling - storytelling with data to inform audiences of insights from data.
- Analytical and Problem Solving - think critically to understand the data and find the best solution based on the data.
- Business Intelligence - processing data into interactive business information.
